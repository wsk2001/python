# Markdown Editor

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

The creator of Markdown(John Gruber) describes it as follows:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
> -- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

This app will serve as an editor/previewer for your Markdown.

Here is the link to the **online version** still in development: [md-editor.fly.dev](https://md-editor.fly.dev/)

I also created a **Medium blog post**. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/@ndonkohenri/building-a-markdown-editor-previewer-with-flet-7d9b06d6dc4b) and let me have a feedback.

### Note
The `markdown2` python library([github](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2), [pypi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2)) must be installed when saving with `.html` extension. 
You are free to use any other library of your choice, or completely remove support for html-output.

### Tip
Markdown has its own _special syntax_, which could be used in the editor. A cheatsheet could help increase your speed, efficiency, and productivity when dealing with Markdown.
